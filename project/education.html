                <h3>Primary Education</h3>
                <p>I went to El-Fouad International School for primary, and my favorite subject was science. I took part in a singing and dancing competition, which was a fun experience. My proudest achievement was acing every term. People saw me as smart but not very sociable, and I was shorter than most of my classmates.</p>

                <h3>Secondary Education</h3>
                <p>At Al-Alson International School, I continued to enjoy science as my favorite subject. I participated in a math competition and learned about manipulation by using friends as pawns. Unfortunately, I faced challenges with fake friends and only had mid-tier relationships with my teachers, making my experience a mix of lessons and struggles.</p>

                <h3>Online Courses</h3>
                <p>I've taken online courses in C++ programming, CS50x, PowerPoint, Excel, and Word. I'm focused on Software Engineering and Computer Science to become a great software engineer. I prefer learning through videos and interactive activities, making platforms like EdX and Udemy my top choices.</p>
